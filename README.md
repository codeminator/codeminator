### Hi there 👋

I am a Software engineer, big fan of open source technologies, always eager to learn about new trends.

My main passion is about Ruby, side from that my wish list includes other things, such as:
- Python
- GoLang.
- Elixir.
- Enhancing my Devops skills.
- Enhancing my frontend development skills.

- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1001022/ahmed-samir-shahin)
- And of course .. over here :)

##### It's not all about work, I have some hobbies as well:
